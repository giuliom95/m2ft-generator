<p>Domestic Boundaries is a research and an exhibition that explores the contemporary dissolution of the domestic environment, operated through devices. Our daily routine is changing and so our spaces.</p>
<p>It explores how the relationship between home and city always promoted and allowed general social change. In the contemporary era, changes in family structure, work organization, technology, gender, communities and communication are reflected in a new revolution that blends the domestic space with that of the city. The dualities of public and private, of exterior and interior, of architecture of the home and architecture of the city are now broken.</p>
<p>This revolution is affecting and involving every aspect of daily life, from body to architecture, sociology to psychology, productivity to reproductivity, isolation to community. It involves also a rediscovery of the crucial role of architecture as a discipline related with many aspects of the social system, and that it could then understand and respond to our current society, abandoning its self-referentiality and theoretical autonomy.</p>
<p>Architecture should understand contemporary transformations, creating new conscient paradigms that better responds to actual needs.</p>
